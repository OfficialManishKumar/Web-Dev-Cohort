 <!-- We can use features like var, let, function using node.js but features like dom are only accessible to browser.  -->
 <!-- In browsers, there is a window object, that consists all the function, methods and features browsers provide to us including things like "console.log" -->
    
 <!-- In window, we have features like alert, that makes an alert in the page. We can use it through both syntaxes: "window.alert" or just "alert". -->
 <!-- Document object of the window object gives us the access of our html code. We can check it by running "window.document" or "document" -->
